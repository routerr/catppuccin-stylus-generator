1. Catch up the progress by always first review the progress-plan.md for the roadmap, then read the progress-log.md for the current progress and know what to do next, if no knowledge or memory is found about the plan or TODO.
2. If no progress-plan.md and progress-log.md, first briefly review the code to understand what have been implemented, then ask the user questions to double check your understand, then ask the user questions about future works or new features to generate a new plan. Always write a progress-plan.md as detailed as possible. Break down one task to a 2~3 layer of subtask inherient, to about 4 ~ 10 small subtasks, to make sure every single instruction in the plan is clear, specified, and needs no futher breakdown.
3. Always update a progress-log.md for your later pickup, reference to the index of the progress-plan.md, to make the record as concise as possible. Record every thing you've designed, created, generated, edited, refactored and re-planned whenever a step is completed or abandoned. If anything implemented is not in the original progress-plan.md, write them down with details in the progress-log.md
4. Always review your plan when a step of it is completed, update the progress-plan.md and progress-log.md accordingly. Make sure everything still reasonably on the path.
