Read all the md files and codes, and create/update memory or knowledge in Antigravity storage. Ask the user question for purpose or other detail of features of the project if anything is not that cleared in the code base. Do this when:

1. There's no memory or knowledge found in the environment of Antigravity storages.
2. Big changes are found or implemented in the code base but not in the knowledge base.
