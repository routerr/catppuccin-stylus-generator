# Agent Knowledge Base

This directory contains "Concept of Minds" artifacts generated by the AI agent to understand and maintain the project. These files serve as a high-level cognitive map of the codebase.

## Artifacts

- **[Architecture Mind](architecture_mind.md)**: High-level system design and data flow.
- **[Deep Analysis Mind](deep_analysis_mind.md)**: Details of the analysis pipeline (CSS variables, SVGs, selectors).
- **[Generation Mind](generation_mind.md)**: Explanation of the V3 dynamic generator and cascading gradients.
- **[Preservation Mind](preservation_mind.md)**: Philosophy and rules for layout preservation.

## Usage

These files are intended to help future agent instances (and human developers) quickly grasp the core philosophies and implementation details of the Catppuccin Stylus Generator without re-reading the entire codebase.
