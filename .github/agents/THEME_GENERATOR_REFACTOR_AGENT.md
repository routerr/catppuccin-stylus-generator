# Theme Generator refactor Agent

/task Please reference to README.md, AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, QUICJSTART.md, DEPLOYMENT.md to understand this project, review the codes under src/services to understand the AI based theme analyzer, coloring and theme generator. And then read the DEEP_ANALYSIS_ARCHITECTURE.md, PROGRESS_REPORT.md, PHASE_1_COMPLETE.md, ROADMAP.md to understand the progress of our work: We are now trying to rebuild the theme generating progress from end-to-end: from new theme analyzing system to the final theme code generator, by referencing to the master piece example Themes/duckduckgo.less. Our goal is to make a more elegant, natural, human made like Catppuccin pallete based web themes that is capable with Stylus, the chrome browser extension.
Now try to catch up state-of-the-art imeplementation, review and refactor them if neccessarry, then try to finish the next steps of rebuilding.
Futher, whenever a benchmark is reached, please record your work in a properly named md file for the next AI session to catch up.
