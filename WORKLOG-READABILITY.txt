Summary of recent changes to improve hover readability and better reflect AI mappings

1) Hover text invisibility fixes
- Restricted gradient text to WebKit-only with both -webkit-background-clip: text and -webkit-text-fill-color: transparent supported.
- Removed non-WebKit gradient text path that relied on color: transparent to avoid invisibility in partially supported engines.
- Kept solid text as the default; gradients are purely progressive enhancement.

2) Contrast-aware fallbacks
- Links: use @accent normally; on hover, if computed min contrast < 4.5, fall back to @text.
- Buttons: gradients on background; text prefers @ALT_MAIN and falls back to @text if contrast < 4.5.
- Removed brightness/saturation filters for predictability.

3) Class-specific coverage
- Expanded class-based rules (from cssAnalysis) in UserStyle, LESS, and Stylus:
  - Buttons, Links, Backgrounds, Text, Borders (color-only).
- Increased per-group class caps from 15–20 to 100 and removed restrictive filters blocking anchors.

4) Keep AI mappings intact
- Disabled pre-filtering of button/clickable background mappings before generation. Generators enforce readability.

5) Prompt alignment across providers
- Added CSS class analysis blocks to prompt (Ollama) and improved mapping guidance (Chutes); OpenRouter prompt class listing fixed.

Files touched (high level)
- src/services/generators/userstyle.ts (hover guards, class coverage, gradient gating)
- src/services/generators/less.ts (added class coverage, hover guards, gradient gating)
- src/services/generators/stylus.ts (added class coverage, hover guards, gradient gating)
- src/services/generators/index.ts (stop discarding AI mappings; pass cssAnalysis to less/stylus)
- src/services/ai/openrouter.ts (class listing bug fix earlier)
- src/services/ai/chutes.ts (distribution guidance and clarity rules)
- src/services/ai/ollama.ts (added css class analysis section)

Rationale
- Favor guaranteed readability over decorative gradients.
- Maximize the chance AI’s class-level suggestions are reflected.
- Keep harmony within Catppuccin palette using main-accent + bi-accent system.
